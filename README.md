## About The Project

This repository is a collection of Java implementations of various data structures and algorithms. The main goal of this project is to provide a simple and easy-to-understand reference for students and developers who are learning or brushing up on their knowledge of DSA.

Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its own file, with comments explaining the logic and the time and space complexity of the operations.
